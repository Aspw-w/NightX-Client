# NightX Client

Due to the majority of features being skidded in FDPClient and a decline in development motivation, updates to the client will be halted. If you still wish to use it, please download the source code and run it. Although the likelihood of public release is low, development itself is continuing under the name "Manifest". Furthermore, as the NightX Client project does not generate any revenue whatsoever, there has been no profit for me either. Thank you for everything up to now.

# Troubleshooting

If NightX fails to launch or provides an error:

- Remove all mods except for NightX to see if it's an incompatibility issue
- If NightX crashes / fails to start, open an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/Aspw-w/NightX-Client/issues)
  - The issue must provide your crash / error log

# Configs
Loading configs is done via the command `.config onlinelist` or `.config onlineload <config_name>`
