# Installation Guide

Note: We only provide support for the official Minecraft Launcher

1. Install [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html) 1.8.9

2. Launch Forge once, then close Minecraft

3. Put nightx.jar inside the mods folder located at `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`

4. Relaunch Minecraft

5. If the main menu has changed, installation is complete!

# Troubleshooting

If NightX fails to launch or provides an error:

- Remove all mods except for NightX to see if it's an incompatibility issue

# Configs
Loading configs is done via the command `.config onlinelist` or `.config onlineload <config_name>`

# Wants ViaVersion?
Install my [ViaForgePlus](https://nattogreatapi.pages.dev/ViaForgePlus) Mod
