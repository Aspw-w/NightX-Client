3. Put nightx-release.jar inside the mods folder located at `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods`

4. Relaunch Minecraft

5. If the main menu has changed, installation is complete!

# Troubleshooting

If NightX fails to launch or provides an error:

- Remove all mods except for NightX to see if it's an incompatibility issue
- If NightX crashes / fails to start, open an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/Aspw-w/NightX-Client/issues)
  - The issue must provide your crash / error log

# Configs
Loading configs is done via the command `.config onlinelist` or `.config onlineload <config_name>`
